Inheritance

> At least 2 classes hsould be there
> person class - attributes(name,age)
> employee class - attributes(employee_id, salary)
> manager class - attribute(dept)

super, parent, name -- class are equivalent
child, derived, subclass -- class are equivalent

4 types of inheritance:
> Single inheritance - only 1 derived class
> Multiple inheritance - base and single derived class; A & B --> C
> Multi level inheritance - when derived class is derived from another derived class; A -> B -> C
> Heirarchy inheritance - combination of Multiple and Multilevel

If we consider work() method for person class, same method can be used in the employee class for work.

Method overriding - A subclass can modify or extend for behaviours of inherited methods.

Super method is a built in function in python used to call methods of parent class from the child class.
Its mainly used to initialise parent class attributes and supports proper inheritance flow.
